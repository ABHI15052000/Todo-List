In this Todo List 

1. We have used forms for the whole todo list content
2. When the user click on add button with the help of eventListener we are everytime adding a new div to our code.
   that div is conating:
   1. A list item
   2. A check button - green in color
   3. A delete button - red in color
3. When the user clicks on delete button (which is red button) we are deleting its parent div with help of remove() function
4. When the user click on check button (green button) we are giving that div a name and handling it with the help of css.
   we are decreasing its opasity and adding a line through it.
5. for the background of this we used a code frame from sand box. Which is other's code to make it more attractive
