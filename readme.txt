In this Todo Assignment

1. I have used forms to fill oout all the details about the title and the agenda.
2. When the user clicks on the add button, with the help of eventListener we are everytime adding a new div
   Every individual div will be containing the following items.
   1. A list item
   2. A check button - green in color
   3. A delete button - red in color
3. When the user clicks on delete button (which is red button) we are deleting its parent div with the help of remove() function.
4. When the user click on the check button (green button) I am giving that div a name and handling it with the help of css.
   We are decreasing its opasity and adding a line through it.
5. for the background of this we used a code frame from sand box. Which is other's code to make it more attractive.
